Implementation of the _s21_graph_algorithms.h_ library:  
* The library must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard
* The library code must be located in the src folder in the develop branch  
* Make it as a static library (with the _s21_graph_algorithms.h_ header file)
* The library must be represented as a ` GraphAlgorithms ` class that stores the implementation of algorithms on graphs. The class `GraphAlgorithms` itself must not know anything about the internal representation of the graph from the class `Graph`. To interact with graph data, the class `GraphAlgorithms` can only use the public methods and properties provided by the `Graph` class. 
* Add to the Makefile _s21_graph_algorithms.a_ target 
*Prepare full coverage of the `GraphAlgorithms` class methods with unit-tests
* The class ` GraphAlgorithms ` must contain at least the following public methods:
    + `depthFirstSearch(Graph &graph, int startVertex)` - a *non-recursive* depth-first search in the graph from a given vertex. The function should return an array that contains the traversed vertices in the order they were traversed. When implementing this function, you must use the *self-written* data structure **stack**, which should be previously made as a separate static library
    + `breadthFirstSearch(Graph &graph, int startVertex)` - breadth-first search in the graph from a given vertex. The function should return an array that contains the traversed vertices in the order they were traversed. When implementing this function, you must use the *self-written* data structure **queue**, which should be previously made as a separate static library
* It is necessary to use *self-written* helper classes `Stack` and `Queue` (you can reuse your solution from the *CPP2* project for this). These classes must contain the following methods:
    + `init()` - creating an empty stack/queue
    + `push(value)` - adding an element to the stack/queue
    + `pop()` - getting an element from the stack/queue followed by its removal from the stack/queue
    + `peek()` - getting an element from the stack/queue without its removal from the stack/queue

*In this and the following tasks, consider that the vertex numbers start from 1*
